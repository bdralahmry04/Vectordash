Happy to share this with my paid patrons, I feel I haven't given you much lately and I want to make up for it!

We have been HARD at work on this Famidash spinoff for a steam game called Vectorball (https://store.steampowered.com/app/2512660/VectorBall/) which will be included in-game with it.

And today, I am sharing it for you all to enjoy!

Features: 11 new tracks, 24 new icons, 9 brand new levels and an endless mode!

I ask that you please do not share this build, a full build WILL eventually drop for everybody in time.
